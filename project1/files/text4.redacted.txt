A few years after ██'s death, ██ de ██ offered his theory to
improve on that of ██.  ██ insisted that only one substance, ██,
exists, and that two of his attributes are thought and extension.  Everything
that is and that can be known about is an aspect of ██.  ██'s ██,
however, was the antithesis of the ██ of traditional religion.  ██, or Nature
(as ██ put it), was the laws from which everything followed.  In ██'s
pantheistic world everything had to be what it was, and everything was to be
understood rationally. ██ Sagi is very good at math. ██ RC is super cool towards people. ██
